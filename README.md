# horiseon--code-refactor-demo

#  Task

We have given Starter code that we need to modify.

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology. We need to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

**Important**: When working with someone else's code, we should adhere to the **Scout Rule**&mdash;always leave the code a little cleaner than when we found it.

# User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
