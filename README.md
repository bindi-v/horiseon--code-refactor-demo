# horiseon--code-refactor-demo

#  Task

We have given Starter code that we need to modify.

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology. We need to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

**Important**: When working with someone else's code, we should adhere to the **Scout Rule**&mdash;always leave the code a little cleaner than when we found it.

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

# User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Feature website 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
